# Campaign Master

A (WIP) AI-enabled TTRPG Planner app. Inspired by previous projects of mine, such as StoryboardWorkshop (A graph creator for branching stories, laid out on a canvas sort of like those classic detective movies w/ the crazed red thread-on-cork style) and Sound-R (a non-linear sound-cue system for use during D&D sessions). This application combines both these concepts into a single interface, where the user can plan a campaign, save it to a file, and then run said plan saving relevant information as necessary. During the planning phase, content is able to be generated and saved to be played back later in a presentation setting with other players.


Progress:

-[ ] ðŸ‘· (~75%, just need to implement the non-complex collection case, for eg Objectives, and ID linking.) Make complete skeleton app capable of collecting and associating useful information. This should be a highly flexible structure, able to adjust to many different TTRPG formats ranging from Dungeons & Dragons 5e, to Pathfinder 2e, to Cyberpunk RED. Should be done by 09/14 as I have some time this weekend to wrap that up, and feel excited to add the LLM suggestions.

-[ ] ðŸ“† Integrate LLM suggestions for planning elements of the campaign. This could be for story segments where you are stuck on what should come next, or for NPCs backstories that need to fulfill a specific role. The idea is you should be able to prompt your use-case.

-[ ] ðŸ“… I have no intentions to profit off this project anything past perhaps donations if people find themselves grateful enough to want to give money to someone for using something. If this ever becomes the case, I will need to update this with a donation link.
